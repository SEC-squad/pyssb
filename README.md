# pyssb

Tool for building Site Specific Browsers with PyQT4.

Currently a rough PoC - it basically works.


TODO:
* Builder
* Icons
* Installing/Building Executables

Works:
* 1Password Anywhere
* Dropbox Notes (runs slow)
* Evernote
* GMail (gives versionof Safari no longer supported warning but works fine)
* Hackpad
* Messenger

Doesn't Work:
* Asana - freaks out
* Wunderlist - doesn't load
* Hangouts - has UA check

Consider...
