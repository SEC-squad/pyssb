# pyssb

pyssb is a package for building general purpose SSBs (Site Specific Browsers) with PyQT5.

## Installation
You may need to install PyQT5 using your OS package manager. You should be able to install the pyssb package via PyPI:
```
sudo pip install -U pyssb
```

## Usage
You should be able to run `pyssb` to generate simple python executables.

If you would like to use pyssb, here's a simple example of what is generated by the `pyssb` generator:

```python
from   PyQt5 import QtWidgets
from   pyssb import *
import sys

ssb_config = {'name':'pyssb','title':'pyssb','url':'https://github.com/lhl/pyssb/'}

if __name__ == "__main__":
  app = QtWidgets.QApplication(sys.argv)
  ssb = SSBWindow(ssb_config)
  ssb.show()
  sys.exit(app.exec_())
```
